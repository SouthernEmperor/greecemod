If you want to help do the following:
-Get a GitHub account so I can add you to the list of people who can commit
-If you want to put anything on here besides txt files and the like (and even with that this makes it significantly easier)
I believe you need to set up git on your computer: 
https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/ 
(helpful instructions are there as well)
-Once I add you, you should clone the greecemod repository with your comp's git so you can edit the folder;
-If you don't want to do this setup, it's not critical; 
just make sure you send the files you want to add to me or someone who can add them, or if you're doing txt files you can just put
them on here. I *think*

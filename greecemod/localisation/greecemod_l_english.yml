 AFRICA_START_TITLE: "Africa"
 AFRICA_START_DESC: "In the west, the remnants of the Ghana empire struggle to remain together, while a tenuous alliance binds the Western States together. Zebulun deals with the pagan population of its neighbors and surroundings. Meanwhile, the Eastern republics struggle to find a common ground against Panic and Isayan threats, while the Exodites look across the sea..."
 ASIA_START_TITLE: "East Asia"
 ASIA_START_DESC: "The Middle Kingdom is divided. The years of outright war have ended, but the Emperor is a weakling, a puppet trapped in his capital. All around him, half a dozen warlords fight for control, even as the Shiwei hordes threaten Huaxia from the north. Meanwhile, in Korea, northern invaders have established dominion across the peninsula. In Japan, half a dozen clans are caught in a protracted struggle for supremacy on the island. And to the south, new kingdoms rise and reign, in Sri Ksetra, Kamboja, and in Mataram."
 EUROPE_START_TITLE: "Europe"
 EUROPE_START_DESC: "The southerners with their strange words of prophets and messiahs do not reign here!"
 HELLAS_START_TITLE: "Rome and Greece"
 HELLAS_START_DESC: "Just as it was in the days of Pericles and Leonidas, Hellas is a group of poleis once more - but they lie threatened, by barbarians, by Muslims, by Christians, and - perhaps most of all - by themselves. To the west, Rome is caught in a brutal civil war between pagans and Muslims. To the south, Egypt is sundered in two. Reclaim peace and prosperity, for great justice!"
 INDIA_START_TITLE: "Hindustan"
 INDIA_START_DESC: "India is truly the crossroads of the world - where else can you find Hellenes, Persians, Africans, Arabs, Chinese, and Malays, all in one place? But India is a land in flux. The once-dominant Seljuk and Chola empires in the north and south have both collapsed into shards. A myriad of petty states and wannabe despots have arisen in their wake. Call to Buddha, or Mithras, or Indra, or Vishnu, or whoever you prefer, as in whomever's time, the time for uniting this divided land has come. Shall you seize it?"
 ISLAM_START_TITLE: "Dar-al-Islam"
 ISLAM_START_DESC: "The touch of the whore of Babylon tarnishes our holy sites! From the riverine fields of Albiyun to the white trees of Qonddar, all the Ummah is in arms. But more often than not, in Firanja, in al-Andalus, and in al-Gharb, our brothers are in arms against themselves. Will Islam reclaim its sacred lands? Or will the piety of this world fade, and we enter a whole new one? Either will do."
 STEPPE_START_TITLE: "The Steppes"
 STEPPE_START_DESC: "From the Scythians in the west to the Magyars in the east, the vast plains of Eastern Europe and Central Asia are home to a thousand peoples in perpetual motion."
 XIAN_START_TITLE: "Christendom"
 XIAN_START_DESC: "The ancient heart of the world lies in the hands of the righteous, but it is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men."
